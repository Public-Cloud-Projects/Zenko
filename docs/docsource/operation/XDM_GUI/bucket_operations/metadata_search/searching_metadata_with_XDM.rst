Searching Metadata with |product|
=================================

   |product|`.
-  Using the ``search_bucket`` tool (found in the
   `Scality/S3 <https://github.com/scality/S3>`__ GitHub repository) as
   described in :ref:`Using search_bucket`.
-  Making an Auth V4-signed HTTP request to |product| as described in
