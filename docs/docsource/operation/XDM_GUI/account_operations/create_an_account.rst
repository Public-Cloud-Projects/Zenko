Create an Account
=================

Because |product| cannot do anything without at least one account to work with,
the first step in any working deployment is to create an account. To create an
account:

#. Log into the |product| UI.

   .. image:: ../../Graphics/xdm_ui_login.png

#. The **CREATE NEW ACCOUNT** window displays.

   .. image:: ../../Graphics/xdm_ui_create_account.png

   Enter a unique account name and the email address for the Storage
   Manager. You can also use the **Quota in GB** field to set a hard upper limit
   on space available to this account. Once the account is created, the quota
   cannot be changed from the |product| UI. If no value is entered, |product|
   imposes no size limit on the account.

   Click **Create**.

#. The **Accounts** view displays with the new account information.

   From this view, the Storage Manager can create, find, and delete accounts, or
   click the **Locations** tab to manage account locations and the buckets they
   contain.
